    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Just be chill. Remember, we're all here to have fun. Don't be overly competitive, be nice to everyone, and help new cubers while they're learning. We want to expand the hobby, not gatekeep it.</li>
        <li>Follow school rules. Even though school is over when we're meeting, we're still at school.</li>
        <li>The Golden Rule: <b>DO TO OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO TO YOU</b>.</li>
    </ol>
