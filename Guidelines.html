    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Just be chill. Remember, we're all here to have fun. Don't be overly competitive, 
        be nice to everyone, and help new cubers while they're learning. 
        We want to expand the hobby, not gatekeep it.</li>
        <li>Follow school rules. (obviously)</li>
        <li>The Golden Rule: <b>DO TO OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO TO YOU</b>.</li>
        <li>Treat our puzzles with respect. 
        Don't draw on them, peel stickers off, or whatever other 
        ideas for destruction you have :3</li>
    </ul>
