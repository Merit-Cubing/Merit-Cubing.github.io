    <h1>Moving Up from Beginner's Method in Cubing: Exploring CFOP, Roux, and ZZ</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>As you become more comfortable with solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube using the beginner’s method, you’ll likely find yourself searching for ways to improve your solve times and efficiency. After all, while the beginner's method is a solid foundation, it is fairly slow and uses fewer algorithms, making it less optimal for advanced solvers. The good news is that there are several advanced methods to help you step up your cubing game, with the most popular being CFOP, Roux, and ZZ.</p>
    <p>In this article, we'll go over these three methods, highlighting their key features, advantages, and drawbacks. Whether you want to stay with a more structured, linear approach or explore something radically different, there’s a method for you to level up your cubing skills.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. CFOP (Fridrich Method)</h2>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>CFOP stands for Cross, F2L (First Two Layers), OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer), and PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer). This method, developed by Jessica Fridrich, is the most widely used method for speedcubing. It builds on the beginner's Layer-by-Layer (LBL) method but is far more efficient.</p>

    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cross:</strong> The first step is to solve a "cross" on one face, usually the white face, by placing the edge pieces correctly relative to the center.</li>
      <li><strong>F2L (First Two Layers):</strong> The next step involves solving both the first and second layers simultaneously. This is the key improvement over the beginner’s method, where you solve the first layer and then solve the second layer separately.</li>
      <li><strong>OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer):</strong> The entire last layer is oriented, meaning all the pieces on the last layer are positioned correctly, but they may not yet be in their final spots.</li>
      <li><strong>PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer):</strong> Finally, the last layer pieces are permuted into their correct locations, completing the solve.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Linear Progression:</strong> CFOP is an ideal choice for solvers who want a natural, progressive improvement from the beginner's method. Moving from LBL to CFOP involves tweaking the process by adding more efficient algorithms, starting with the cross and gradually moving toward faster F2L and OLL techniques.</li>
      <li><strong>Widely Used:</strong> CFOP is the go-to method for most competitive speedcubers, so there's a huge amount of community support, tutorials, and resources to help you improve.</li>
      <li><strong>Structured:</strong> Because CFOP is broken down into distinct stages, it provides a clear framework for learning and progression.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Algorithm Heavy:</strong> To achieve the highest speeds, you need to memorize a large number of algorithms—over 100 for F2L, OLL, and PLL combined. This can be daunting for beginners and requires significant time and effort to master. There is a more beginner-friendly approach to start with, with something called intuitive F2L, and two-look OLL/PLL. This has 16 algorithms to learn.</li>
      <li><strong>Less Intuitive:</strong> While CFOP is great for optimizing solves, the method can feel mechanical and rigid, especially when compared to more fluid methods like Roux or ZZ.</li>
      <li><strong>Higher Movecount:</strong> A solve with full CFOP averages around 50-60 moves. While it may be far more efficient than layer-by-layer, it is still higher than other speedsolving methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Roux Method</h2>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>The Roux method, invented by Gilles Roux, is another way to solve the cube that takes a more intuitive, block-building approach to solving the cube. It focuses on creating and solving two 3x2x1 blocks on opposite sides of the cube, followed by the final two layers.</p>

    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First Block:</strong> The solver begins by creating a 3x2x1 block on one side of the cube, usually the left.</li>
      <li><strong>Second Block:</strong> A second 3x2x1 block is then created on the opposite side of the cube (usually the right).</li>
      <li><strong>CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer):</strong> After solving the first two blocks, the solver uses an algorithm to orient and position the corners of the last layer.</li>
      <li><strong>LSE (Last Six Edges):</strong> Finally, the solver solves the remaining edge pieces in the last layer in a sequence of moves to complete the cube.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fewer Moves:</strong> Roux tends to require fewer moves on average than CFOP due to its block-building nature, which often results in faster solves. It’s a more "hands-on" method that often feels more natural to some solvers. (Average movecount of 45-50 with proficient solvers.)</li>
      <li><strong>Less Algorithm Intensive:</strong> Roux requires fewer algorithms than CFOP, particularly in the last layer, making it appealing for those who dislike memorizing long algorithm sets.</li>
      <li><strong>More Intuitive:</strong> Roux is considered to be more flexible and intuitive, especially in the block-building stages. It’s a good choice for cubers who prefer a less rigid method.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotationless:</strong> Roux does not use cube rotations, which allows for fluidity and higher accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Harder to Learn:</strong> While Roux is more intuitive, it can also be more challenging to learn initially, especially because it doesn’t follow a traditional "layer-by-layer" approach. The concept of building blocks and solving edges before corners can be tough to grasp at first.</li>
      <li><strong>Less Community Support:</strong> While Roux is growing in popularity, it’s still not as widely used as CFOP, which means there are fewer resources and tutorials available.</li>
      <li><strong>Not as Efficient for Everyone:</strong> Roux can be difficult to optimize for certain cubers, and achieving top-tier performance requires a lot of practice and refining of techniques.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. ZZ Method</h2>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>The ZZ method, created by Zbigniew Zborowski, is an advanced method that focuses on efficiency by utilizing edge orientation early in the solve. ZZ combines elements of CFOP and Roux while introducing unique techniques that prioritize edge orientation to reduce the number of moves later in the solve.</p>

    <h3>How it works:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>EOLine (Edge Orientation Line):</strong> The first step is to orient all the edges of the cube while simultaneously solving the first two layers’ edges, creating a "line" on the cube. This is a key innovation of ZZ.</li>
      <li><strong>F2L:</strong> The next step is similar to CFOP, where the first two layers are solved, but since the edges are already oriented, the solver can do this with fewer moves.</li>
      <li><strong>LL (Last Layer):</strong> In the final step, the last layer is solved using algorithms that are efficient because the edges have already been oriented, reducing the complexity of OLL and PLL stages.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pros:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Edge Orientation Early:</strong> By orienting all edges at the beginning, ZZ reduces the need to reorient the edges during the last layer, which can save a significant number of moves and time.</li>
      <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> ZZ tends to be one of the most efficient methods in terms of move count, as its structure reduces unnecessary rotations and movements.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithmic Elegance:</strong> ZZ has a reputation for its elegant, smooth algorithm sets that can be easier to optimize compared to CFOP, especially once you’re familiar with the method.</li>
      <li><strong>Low Movecount:</strong> Like Roux, ZZ allows a low movecount of around 45-50.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cons:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Steep Learning Curve:</strong> ZZ’s edge orientation step can be challenging for beginners, and learning the method requires a solid understanding of cubing fundamentals before transitioning.</li>
      <li><strong>Less Popular:</strong> While ZZ is highly efficient, it’s less widely used than CFOP and Roux, so there may be fewer learning resources and less community support.</li>
      <li><strong>Not Ideal for Everyone:</strong> ZZ's method might feel cumbersome or unnatural to those who prefer the layer-by-layer approach of CFOP or the block-building flexibility of Roux.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Which Method Should You Choose?</h2>
    <p>The choice between CFOP, Roux, and ZZ ultimately depends on your preferences and goals as a cuber.</p>
    <p>If you're looking for a natural progression from beginner’s method and want a well-structured path to improving your solve times, CFOP is the most logical next step. Its clear stages and massive community support make it an ideal method for those who want to follow a proven, step-by-step approach to speedcubing.</p>
    <p>If you're drawn to a more intuitive, block-building method and are comfortable with experimenting, Roux might be the perfect choice. It requires fewer algorithms and is more flexible, but it can be harder to master.</p>
    <p>If you're interested in maximizing efficiency and reducing unnecessary moves, ZZ offers an elegant solution with its unique edge orientation step, though it requires more effort to learn.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. Each method has its strengths and challenges, so explore them and see which one resonates with you as you move beyond the beginner's method. Happy cubing!</p>
